# Healthcolate

Run app.js to run this application

This application uses NodeJS and Express to provide a service that lets users enter their health parameters which can be then compared to the average health parameters
of the other users and then provides some recommendations based on that. Data is stored in a non relational database MongoDb. Hashing is implemented in the project 
where a block of data has a hash of the previous entry and the next entry to further develop the service into a blockchain service for extra security.
